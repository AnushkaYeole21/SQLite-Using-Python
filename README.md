# SQLite3 course (Python + Jupyter)
Welcome to `SQLite3 with Python` Course! This course is designed for beginners who want to learn practical database management using SQLite in a Jupyter notebook. It's perfect for aspiring data scientists, software developers, or anyone looking to build small to medium-sized applications that require efficient data storage and manipulation without the complexity of a server-based database system.

The theoretical part of databases (e.g., relational databases, SQL fundamentals) has been covered in a prior MySQL course. Now, we aim to transition to SQLite3, emphasizing code execution and real-world usage scenarios.

#Learning Objectives
By the end of this course you will learn:
- Understand how **SQLite** differs from other database systems like **MySQL**.
- Set up and manage an SQLite database using Pythonâ€™s sqlite3 module in Jupyter notebooks.
- Perform common database operations such as creating tables, inserting, updating, and deleting records.
- Write advanced SQL queries with JOIN, GROUP BY, HAVING, and aggregate functions.

#Course Format
1. Practical Execution: Every database operation is demonstrated through code in a Jupyter Notebook, allowing students to interactively execute queries, manipulate data, and see immediate results.
2. Step-by-Step Code Examples: Each lesson contains code snippets that demonstrate SQLite3 operations, making it easy for students to follow along and practice independently.
3. Hands-On Project: By the end of the course, students will apply their knowledge in a minor project (e.g., a School Management Database) to solidify their learning.
